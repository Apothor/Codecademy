# Fibonacci Finder

This week’s challenge is a very common interview question and was reported to have been asked in interviews at many top companies including **Google**.

## Basic difficulty

Write a function, `fibonacciFinder50`, that will find the 50th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

* **Function Name**: `fibonacciFinder50`
* **Input**: There are no parameters to this function
* **Output**: an integer, the 50th number in the Fibonacci Sequence
* **Example**: `fibonacciFinder50() => 7778742049`
* In the Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), the first two numbers are 0 and 1 and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
* For this challenge, consider 0 to be the 1st Fibonacci Number, not the 0th (i.e. do not zero-index)

## Intermediate difficulty

Write a function, `fibonacciFinderN`, that will find the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

* **Function Name**: `fibonacciFinderN`
* **Input**: any integer, n, where n is a natural number (in this case not including 0)
* **Output**: an integer, the nth number in the Fibonacci Series
* **Example**: `fibonacciFinderN(300) => 137347080577163115432025771710279131845700275212767467264610201`
* Please use this example – the 300th Fibonacci Number – with your submission

Hard difficulty

Write `fibonacciFinderN` as *efficiently as possible*.

* Can you solve this challenge in O(n) time complexity?
* Many of you will still find that this challenge is too easy (and this is not [unusual](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/code-challenges-in-interviews/82161)), so see how you can stretch yourself further. Can you solve this problem in an unorthodox or elegant way? How about in a different language? Take this opportunity to show off your scripting skills and creative outside-the-box thinking!
