# Prime Number Printer

This weekâ€™s challenge was reported to have been asked in interviews at **Facebook**

## Basic difficulty

Write a function, `primeNumberDetector`, that tests if a number, n is a prime number.

* **Function Name**: `primeNumberDetector`
* **Input**: `integer n`
* **Output**: `boolean: true` if n is a prime number else `false`.

* **Example**: `primeNumberDetector(13) => True`

## Intermediate difficulty

Write a function, `primeNumberPrinter`, that will print out all prime numbers in a given string.

* **Function Name**: `primeNumberPrinter`
* **Input**: A single `string`
* **Output**: An `integer array` of the prime numbers contained in the string
* **Example:** `primeNumberPrinter("abc2134kd31")`, will output an array `[2,13,3,3,31]` (in the order they appear in the string).

## Hard difficulty

Write `primeNumberDetector` and `primeNumberPrinter` as *efficiently as possible*.
