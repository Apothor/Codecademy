# Sum of Prime Factors

## Intermediate Difficulty
> Write a function that finds the sum of all [prime factors](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/code-challenges-in-interviews/82161) of a given number, n.
Try to write your function without using [trial division](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html)!

## Intermediate Difficulty
If you’d like to go a step further:
> Write a function that finds the sum of each unique prime factor of a given number, n. For example, 3 is the only prime factor of 9.

## Advanced Difficulty
For a final, more advanced challenge, your code should run in sub-linear time (find out what we mean by reading about Big O notation and complexity [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation) and [here](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation). There’s also an old (and thus unsupported) Codecademy course on Big O [here](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog).
