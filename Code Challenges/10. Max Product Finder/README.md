# Max Product Finder

This week’s challenge was reported to have been asked in interviews at **Google**.

## Basic difficulty

Given an array of integers, write a function, `maxProductFinder`, that finds the largest product that can be obtained from any 3 integers in the array.

* **Function Name**: `maxProductFinder`
* **Input**: `int[]` - an array of integers
* **Output**: an `integer` – the maximum product found from any three integers in the array
* **Example**: `maxProductFinder([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9]) => 432`
* You may assume that the array contains at least three integers
* Please run the following array as a test: `[-6, -8, 4, 2, 5, 3, -1, 9, 10]`

## Intermediate difficulty

Given an array of integers, write a function, `maxProductFinderK`, that can be obtained from any k integers in the array.

* **Function Name**: `maxProductFinderK`
* **Input**: `int[]` - an array of integers and an integer k where k is the number of ints that can be used
* **Output**: an `integer` – the maximum product found from any k integers in the array
* **Example**: `maxProductFinderK([-8, 6, -7, 3, 2, 1, -9], 2) => 72`
* You may presume that the length of the array of integers is greater or equal to k

## Hard difficulty

Write maxProductFinder and maxProductFinderK as *efficiently as possible*.
