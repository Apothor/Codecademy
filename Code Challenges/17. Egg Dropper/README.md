# Egg Dropper

This week’s challenge was reported to have been asked in interviews at Microsoft.

## Basic Difficulty

Suppose that you had 100 eggs in a 100-floor skyscraper, and you wanted to conduct an experiment to find out the highest floor (`criticalFloor`) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it… but you’re also really hungry so you don’t want to waste any eggs.
rite a function, `minEggDropper100`, that will determine the minimum number of egg drops (`minDrops100`) you’d need to find the `criticalFloor`.

* **Function Name**: `minEggDropper100`
* **Output**: `minDrops100` – an integer representing the minimum number of drops needed to find the criticalFloor
* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
* A broken egg must be discarded.
* The eggs are all incredibly similar – the effect of a fall from a particular floor is the same for all eggs.
* If an egg survives a fall from floor `n`, then it would also survive a fall from the floors below it: floor `n-1`, floor `n-2`, etc.
* If an egg does not survive a fall from floor `n`, then it would also not survive a fall from the floors above it: floor `n+1`, floor `n+2`, etc.
* You should not presume that an egg would survive a fall from the first floor, nor should you presume that it would not survive a fall from the 100th floor!
* Much of the challenge in this problem is in formulating your strategy for egg dropping – interviewers want to see how you think in breaking down and solving this problem. Perhaps consider first how you would solve this problem with only one egg. Then think how you’d solve this problem with infinite eggs without any code. After that, think how you can use coding to find `criticalFloor` more efficiently.
* Remember: the challenge is not to find `criticalFloor` itself! Your function should return the minimum number of egg drops you need to find `criticalFloor`.
* Try not to Google for help or check other responses online for solutions or help – see how you can solve this problem yourself!

**Don’t forget: you must explain your thought processes and solution!**

## Intermediate difficulty

> You’re at another 100-floor skyscraper and want to perform another experiment but this time you have only two eggs.
> Write a function, `minEggDropper2`, that will determine the minimum number of egg drops (`minDrops2`) you’d need to find the highest floor (`criticalFloor2`) from which you could drop an egg without breaking it.

* **Function Name**: `minEggDropper2`
* **Output**: `minDrops2` – an integer representing the minimum number of drops needed to find `criticalFloor2`

## Hard Difficulty

> Write `minEggDropperX` that will test for `x` many eggs and `y` many floors. Please write this as efficiently as possible!
