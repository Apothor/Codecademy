# Reverse Words

For this week’s challenge, inspired by a question reported to have been asked in developer job interviews at Microsoft (and also inspired by Yoda in honor of Star Wars Day!):

## Basic Difficulty

> Write a function that will take a given [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) and reverse the order of the words. `“Hello world”` becomes `“world Hello”` and `“May the Fourth be with you”` becomes `“you with be Fourth the May”`

You may assume that the string is a sentence that contains only letters and spaces, with all words separated by one space.
If you find this challenge easy, that’s actually [not unusual](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/code-challenges-in-interviews/82161) in interview situations, but interviewers often ask you to not only thoroughly explain your process but to up your game in an extension to the initial challenge, so you should definitely try for extra credit (see below)!

## Intermediate difficulty

> The string in question now has punctuation, for example `“Hello world!”` and `“With you, be May the Fourth”` Write a function to reverse the order of words, but keep the punctuation in place. For example, turn `"Hello world!"` into `“world Hello!”` and `“With you, be May the Fourth.”` to `“Fourth the, May be you With.”`

In the case of multiple consecutive punctuation marks or multiple consecutive whitespace characters, deal with them as you see fit.

## Hard Difficulty

If you’d like to go even further:

> Can you solve the initial challenge (without punctuation) [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) without using additional [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), and with the [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) being O(n)? Can you do the same for the intermediate level challenge (including punctuation)?
