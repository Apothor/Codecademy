# Anagram Detector

For this week’s challenge, inspired by a question reported to have been asked in developer job interviews at Microsoft:
> Write a function in your favorite programming language that will accept any two [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) as parameters and return “1” if they are [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) and “0” if they are not.

For simplicity’s sake, focus only on strings composed from uppercase letters (in hex ASCII - from 41 (A) to 5A (Z)) and space characters.

## Intermediate Difficulty
If you’d like to go a step further:
> Make sure that your answer has no more than O(n + m) time complexity 65, where n is the length of the first string and m of the second.

Make your submission as efficient as possible! You can presume that the hypothetical interviewer in this case is looking for the most direct approach that does not involve len(n)! permutations.
